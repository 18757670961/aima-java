In this notebook we will show how to use the code repository to tame unceratinty with degrees of belief. In this notebook we will concentrate on the task of representing and computing with probabilistic information in general. First, let's load the aima-jar."

    "For our agent to represent and use probabilistic information, we need a formal language. Appendix A(from text) includes a standard introduction to\n",
    "elementary probability theory. Here, we take an approach more suited to the needs of AI and\n",
    "more consistent with the concepts of formal logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "In probability\n",
    "theory, the set of all possible worlds is called the **sample space**. The possible worlds are\n",
    "mutually exclusive and exhaustive—two possible worlds cannot both be the case, and one\n",
    "possible world must be the case. For example, if we are about to roll two (distinguishable)\n",
    "dice, there are $36$ possible worlds to consider: $(1,1), (1,2), . . ., (6,6)$. The Greek letter $\\Omega$\n",
    "(uppercase omega) is used to refer to the sample space, and $\\omega$ (lowercase omega) refers to\n",
    "elements of the space, that is, particular possible worlds.\n",

    "A fully specified **probability model** associates a numerical probability $P (\\omega)$ with each\n",

    "hand, if the dice conspire to produce the same number, then the worlds (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), etc.,\n",
    "might have higher probabilities, leaving the others with lower probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic assertions and queries are not usually about particular possible worlds, but\n",
    "about sets of them.In AI,\n",
    "the sets are always described by propositions in a formal language.Propositions describing sets of possible worlds are written in a notation that combines elements of propositional logic and constraint satisfaction notation.The probability associated with a proposition is defined to be the sum of the probabilities of the worlds in which it holds\n",
