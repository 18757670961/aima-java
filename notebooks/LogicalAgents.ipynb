    " This notebook serves as a supporting material for the chapter **Logical Agents**. The notebooks illustrate the use of the code repository and demonstrate how the code can be extended to solve various related problems. We begin with overall agent design, introduce a simple new environment, the wumpus world, and illustrate the operation of knowledge-based agent. Then we have a look at the gernal principles of **logic** and the specifics of **propositional logic** and with well-developed inference technologies. At last, we combine the concept of knowledge-based agents with technology of propositional logic to build some simple agents for the wumpus world."

    "The central component of a knowledge-based agent is its **knowledge base**, or **KB**. A knowledge base is a set of **sentences**. (Here “sentence” is used as a technical term. It is related but not identical to the sentences of English and other natural languages.) Each sentence is expressed in a language called a **knowledge representation language** and represents some assertion about the world. Sometimes we dignify a sentence with the name **axiom**, when the\n",
    "sentence is taken as given without being derived from other sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "There must be a way to add new sentences to the knowledge base and a way to query what is known. The standard names for these operations are TELL and ASK, respectively.Both operations may involve **inference**—that is, deriving new sentences from old. Inference must obey the requirement that when one ASKs a question of the knowledge base, the answer should follow from what has been told (or TELLed) to the knowledge base previously."
